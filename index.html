        <p>I shoot natural light only, therefore, i love to have the session be outdoors and love to take advantage of the beautiful wisconsin landscapes!  if you have a location in mind that you would like your session to be held at, please feel free to suggest it!  otherwise, i have a ton of great ideas and locations.</p>

<p><a href="http://swoonbeam.com/">Swoon Beam Photography</a> has always been an interest of mine but i can thank my husband and kids for helping me really discover my love for it! my husband surprised me with my first dslr and i went from being the typical "momtographer" to quickly becoming obsessed. i couldn't stop reading about it, taking classes, and pressing the shutter (and still can't)â€¦ and well, here i am today.</p>
